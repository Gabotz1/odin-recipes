# odin-recipes
The project will consis of a main index page with will have links to a few recipes.

Odin project lead me to some new skill in HTML coding.
At this project I will create a basic recipe website using those HTML skills which I assume will be create the entire HTML boiler plate, create the index page with a list of some recipes and create links to other webpage that will displays the ingredients and steps (wich bassically means an unordered list and and order list and images of course). 

Some directories for index and recepies pages will be needed as well so kep it mind all the commands needed for directories and file, use the glosary.

Don't focus on the style Gabo, one step a the time.
